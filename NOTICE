# ISO20022 Message Generator

This project is a Python-based tool for generating and parsing ISO 20022 messages. It provides a library for programmatic use.

## Fedwire Payments

This project can be used to generate the message content for Fedwire payments, which utilize the ISO 20022 standard. However, the message envelope format for Fedwire is proprietary. Users must obtain the necessary proprietary XSD files from the Federal Reserve and integrate them to create complete Fedwire messages. This project does not include any proprietary information or files.

For more information on Fedwire's ISO 20022 implementation and to access the required files, please visit the [Federal Reserve ISO 20022 Implementation Center](https://www.frbservices.org/resources/financial-services/wires/iso-20022-implementation-center).



## Dependencies

The project relies on the following external libraries:

- **lxml**: For XML parsing and validation.
- **pydantic**: For data validation and settings management.
- **Flask**: For the web application interface.

These dependencies are listed in the `pyproject.toml` file.
